            <main>
                <p> I started my experience with color guard my junior year of high school. 
                    I had no idea what I was doing, but in later years I found that the way 
                    I was learning (just throwing things around and hoping I'd catch them) 
                    was the absolute best way to learn. I first started learning flag, 
                    then picked up a rifle, and very hesitantly tried saber. I continued 
                    this adventure of learning into my senior year of high school, which 
                    lead me to try out for my very first color guard, Music City Drum and Bugle Corps.
                    I was not at all good compared to the other people auditioning, 
                    but I learned some really cool things and met some awesome people that
                    I am still in contact with today! </p>

                <p>My journey then lead me to start working with color guard programs.
                    I went back to my home high school, Edwardsville, and asked if I 
                    could start assisting with the color guard to improve upon my teaching
                    and performing skills. I learned a ton about what it meant to be a color
                    guard coach and what it took to pass on the skills to others who had no 
                    prior experience. That fall I decided to audition for my very first winter
                    guard, Avidity Indepedent. I was way more confident for this audition that I 
                    was for Music City! I had learned a ton about the activity and was able to see
                    my coaching come alive in the 30+ students I had begun to teach at Edwardsville.
                    I was auditioning for the Open class guard, but later found out that they started
                    an A class guard that was a step below. I glady accepted the position and began
                    to learn even more than I ever had before. This program would come to change my 
                    life over the next 3 years.</p>

                <p>I started performing with a group, Avidity Independent of Mckendree University&copy. My very first show was called Connected, and it was a show about being Connected 
                    to one another through the activity of color guard. We performed to the music of 
                    The Whiffenpoofs, with the song, Rainbow Connection. Watch the video below if you'd 
                    like to see what it looked like!</p>

                <p>Fast forwarding a couple months and I have now become the color guard director for
                    Edwardsville High School. I took on a huge task for such a wonderful school, but 
                    I felt that my experience with Avidity had prepared me for the large task. I 
                    began working with the students to get the program to the next level. We were currently
                    performing in the class Scholastic C, which was the 2nd lowest class. The first show I 
                    did with them was titled, Men of Snow, and was a complicated show about the process of 
                    death and how just like snowmen, we all melt away someday. The song was by Ingrid Michaelson
                    and it really hit the emotional strings of many. We completed the season in 4th place out of
                    9 units in our class </p>
                <p>Another year with Avidity comes and goes, this year more powerful and challenging. We performed
                    the song, Time to say goodbye which is a popular love song by Andrea Bocelli and Sarah Brightman.
                    With this show we actually won the St. Louis WGI regional, which was very surprising for it only
                    being our second year out. We finished the season strong with a silver medal. Half way through this
                    season I was promoted to rifle captain, where I helped run rehearsals and do logistics for competions.
                    This role helped prepare me for more director and performing roles in the future. </p>

                <p>I continued to work with EHS with new goals set for the team. We decided that we were going to get
                    a promotion this year, no matter what it took! We created the produciton, Before Goodbye, that 
                    was performed to the song, This Ain't Goodbye by Train. The show was set at an old bus stop where
                    4 benches were used to demonstrate the theme. The students wore 4 different costumes with the same
                    type of fabrics that made them look old fashioned. The students pushed us at every single rehearsal 
                    to make them better, and we did our very best. Our very first weekend out for competition we were 
                    promoted! We didn't even have half of the show finished, and the students didn't have costumes! 
                    The show was that well designed and performed that the costumes and full show only added that much 
                    more!</p>

                <p> All in all I learned many things from the color guard. The following were the most important ones that
                    have stuck with me until today.

                    <ol>
                        <li> Hard work pays off!</li>
                        <li> Your teammates are your greatest resources.</li>
                        <li> When you feel like you're a failure, just look back on everything the activity has helped you
                            accomplish.</li>
                        <li> No one understands what you do, you must show them how much it means to you.</li>
                    </ol></p>
                <footer>One phrase that has stuck with me to today is OWINO, Our work is never over.</footer>
